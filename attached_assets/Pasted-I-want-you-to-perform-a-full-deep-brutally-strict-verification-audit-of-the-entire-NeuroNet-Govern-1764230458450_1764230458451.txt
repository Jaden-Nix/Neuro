I want you to perform a full, deep, brutally strict verification audit of the entire NeuroNet Governor project you generated.

Your task is to confirm whether the final project fulfills 100% of the required features, constraints, and track requirements.
You MUST check each point individually — do NOT give a summary.
Produce a line-by-line compliance matrix showing PASS / FAIL for every requirement.
