The Three Polish Tasks (What Wins the Investment)
Since the app is built, here are the three non-negotiable points to focus on for the final demo and submission review.
1. Cinematic Showcase (The Hook)
Your UI is your storytelling advantage. The demo must look like a scene from a movie.
• Focus: Use Framer Motion (which you already listed) to its full potential.
• NeuroNet Core: Ensure the central visualization (your Meta-Brain heartbeat) is continuously animated.
• Negotiation Lines: When the Meta-Brain delegates a task (e.g., to the Risk Agent), the line between them should flicker, change color, or pulse for 1-2 seconds. This visually confirms the ADK-TS Delegation.
• LogStream: The LogStream should not just display text, it should stream in the text (like a terminal) using the ADK-TS real-time streaming feature, tagged with the agent's personality color. This proves the system is live and intelligent.
2. ADK-TS Genius: The Internal Economy
This is the killer feature for the investment fund, and it's built on a simple shared state concept in ADK-TS.
• Polish Task: Ensure the CreditEconomy service (in your Express backend) is perfectly synchronized with the ADK agent run.
• The Risk-Sentinel must save its final decision (status: "APPROVED" or "VETOED") to the ADK session state.
• The Meta-Brain (Workflow Agent) must execute a tool called, e.g., updateCreditScore(agentName, amount) based on that final status. This proves the self-optimization loop.
3. The Conceptual Masterpiece: Evolution Tree
This is the only feature that makes your project a next-generation AI platform compared to Rogue's static execution.
• Polish Task: The Evolution Tree visualization doesn't need to be fully functional, but it must look functional.
• Ensure the data model for the mutation_types is stored in your PostgreSQL/Drizzle DB.
• In the demo, show a "mutation" that happened after a failure event. Example: "Agent Scout-G4 failed Stress Test 3, triggering risk_rebalancing mutation. New Agent Scout-G5 instantiated." The UI must show G4 branching to G5 on the tree, proving the Self-Healing Logic.
