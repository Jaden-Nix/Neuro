Here’s the cleanest, simplest, but most impressive backtesting design you can implement in just a few hours — and judges will think it’s extremely advanced.

I’ll break it down exactly how a good backtesting system should work, from UX → engine → internal logic → outputs.

⸻

✅ 1. The Core Idea (How backtesting should work)

A proper backtester does ONE thing:

Replay old market data into your agents as if it were happening live.

That means:
	•	your agents “think” normally
	•	they produce decisions
	•	you track every decision and calculate profit/loss

This makes your system look alive and proves intelligence.

⸻

✅ 2. Minimal API Flow (perfect for hackathon)

(1) Start a backtest

POST /api/backtest/start
{
  "symbol": "ETH-USD",
  "interval": "1m",
  "from": "2024-01-01",
  "to": "2024-01-10",
  "agent_set": ["Atlas", "Vega", "Nova"]
}

You store this session, load historical candles.

(2) Replay price data

Either:
	•	stream each candle every ~50ms
or
	•	loop through instantly and call the agent logic.

Example internal event:

onCandle(ethPriceCandle) → for each agent → agent.decide(candle)

(3) Record trades

Every time an agent returns:
	•	BUY
	•	SELL
	•	or HOLD

You log:

timestamp
price
action
reason
agent_name
confidence

(4) Close the backtest

POST /api/backtest/{id}/finish

Then you compute all performance metrics.

⸻

✅ 3. What a GOOD backtesting engine must track

You only need 6 core metrics:

🔹 1. Total trades

Counts every buy/sell executed.

🔹 2. Win rate

(# of profitable trades) / (total trades)

🔹 3. Average ROI per trade

You compute ROI like:

(buyPrice → sellPrice) = ROI%

🔹 4. Cumulative return

How much the agent “grew” over the entire backtest.

🔹 5. Maximum drawdown

Biggest loss from a peak.

🔹 6. Best + worst agents

Rank them by Sharpe ratio or ROI.

⸻

✅ 4. Internally (How the logic should actually work)

Here’s the simplest correct architecture:

⸻

⭐ Step 1 — For each candle

for candle in history:
    for agent in agents:
        decision = agent.think(candle)
        if decision.action == "BUY" or "SELL":
            executeSimulatedTrade(agent, decision, candle.price)


⸻

⭐ Step 2 — Simulate trades

Super simple:

if agent has no open trade:
      open trade at this price
else:
      close the previous trade
      compute ROI
      store trade result

You don’t need:
❌ order books
❌ slippage
❌ gas
❌ market depth

Just buy → sell → capture profit.

⸻

⭐ Step 3 — Store the decision trace

Example:

{
  "agent": "Atlas",
  "action": "BUY",
  "price": 2103.52,
  "reason": "Detected momentum accumulation + increased depth",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-02T10:15:00Z"
}

Judges LOVE this transparency.

⸻

✅ 5. The Backtest Summary (what to output)

THIS is what wins hackathons.

Example perfect summary:

Backtest Results (ETH-USD, Jan 1–Jan 10)

Trades executed: 134
Win rate: 62.9%
Total return: +18.3%
Sharpe ratio: 1.14
Max drawdown: -6.7%

Top performing agent: Atlas v7 (+27.4%)
Worst performing agent: Vega v3 (-4.2%)

Insights:
• Agents detected 3 volatility clusters
• Most profitable pattern: mean reversion during low liquidity hours
• Stress tests triggered: 1

This makes your entire system feel like a real quant platform.

⸻

✅ 6. Backtesting UI or output

You only need a simple JSON + maybe one line of text:

Backtest completed in 4.2s
Atlas: +27%
Vega: -4%
Nova: +12%

No charts are required.

⸻

🎯 Why this is the best feature to finish now

Backtesting gives you:

✔ Proof your agents actually work

✔ Real measurable performance

✔ A strong scoring edge vs other teams

✔ Judges instantly trust your agents

✔ Makes your whole system feel professional & finished

Backtesting is literally the “adult feature” of agent frameworks.

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ full backtest API code structure
✅ data schema
✅ example JSON logs
✅ agent performance calculator
Just say “give me the full backtesting code structure” and I’ll drop it clean.
