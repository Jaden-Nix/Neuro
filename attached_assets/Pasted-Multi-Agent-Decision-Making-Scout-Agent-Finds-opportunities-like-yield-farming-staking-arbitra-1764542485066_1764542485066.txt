Multi-Agent Decision-Making
	•	Scout Agent: Finds opportunities like yield farming, staking, arbitrage.
	•	Risk Agent: Evaluates safety, calculates potential loss, can veto dangerous decisions.
	•	Execution Agent: Plans transactions, gas, order of actions, success probability.
	•	Meta Agent: Orchestrates all agents, makes final APPROVE/REJECT decisions.
Why it matters: Decisions aren’t single-threaded—they’re analyzed from all angles.

⸻

2. Continuous 24/7 Monitoring
	•	Agents are always active, querying market data and protocol states.
	•	No downtime; can react faster than human governance ever could.

⸻

3. Real-Time Decision Logging
	•	Every decision (Scout → Risk → Execution → Meta) is logged and auditable.
	•	Logs stored in MemoryVault smart contract → fully on-chain transparency.
Why it matters: You can prove the AI’s reasoning at any time.

⸻

4. Multi-Signature & Safety Controls
	•	Multi-sig gating: Transactions require approval (e.g., 3/5 signatures).
	•	Circuit breaker: Pauses agents automatically if risk is high or losses exceed thresholds.
	•	Safe Mode: Restricts risky trades, ensures conservative execution.
	•	Human override: Governance can pause or veto any decision instantly.

Why it matters: AI can’t go rogue; all decisions are accountable.

5. ATP Integration (Agent Tokenization Platform)
	•	Agents can be tokenized on-chain, published to ATP.
	•	Live performance metrics feed ATP leaderboard.
	•	Agents can evolve: top performers spawn new generations.
	•	Community can stake IQ tokens on agents for passive yield.

Why it matters: Agents become on-chain assets with verifiable performance.

⸻

6. On-Chain Audit Trail
	•	Each agent’s input/output, reasoning, and execution steps are stored on-chain.
	•	Historical decisions can be replayed and audited anytime.

Why it matters: Judges or users can verify everything is transparent and trustless.

⸻

7. Portfolio & Risk Management
	•	Tracks TVL (Total Value Locked), yields, and exposures.
	•	Real-time dashboards visualize risk across protocols.
	•	Monte Carlo simulations predict outcomes before committing funds.

Why it matters: It’s not just “find opportunities,” it’s safe capital deployment.

⸻

8. Performance Tracking & Agent Evolution
	•	Each agent has a credit score: rewards success, punishes failures.
	•	Poor agents are deprecated; good ones can spawn new versions.
	•	Continuous improvement over time.

Why it matters: The system self-optimizes and improves without human rewriting code.

⸻

9. Multi-Chain Support
	•	Works on Ethereum, Base, Fraxtal, Solana, with live RPC connections.
	•	Can orchestrate transactions and decisions across multiple chains simultaneously.

⸻

10. Real-Time Dashboard & Visualization
	•	Shows agent status, credit scores, decision flow, and live logs.
	•	Risk heatmaps highlight danger zones in real time.
	•	Can filter by agent type, confidence, outcome, or protocol.
