What a Solid Wallet-Tracking System Should Provide

1. Unified Multi-Chain / Multi-Wallet Overview
	•	Support for multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Base, Fraxtal, Solana, etc.) — as you planned.  ￼
	•	Ability to track multiple wallets simultaneously (user’s own wallets, or even “watch-only” wallets / treasury wallets).  ￼
	•	Real-time token balances + fiat valuation (or native coin valuation) across all wallets/chain.  ￼
	•	Transaction history summary: deposits, withdrawals, staking, liquidity-pool positions, transfers.  ￼

Why this matters: For a complex system like yours, where agents may execute trades, governance decisions, or rebalancing across chains — you want a global “net worth / exposure snapshot”.

2. DeFi & Protocol Position Tracking (not just raw tokens)
	•	Recognize LP positions, staking, loans, pools, bridged assets, locked tokens, etc.  ￼
	•	Show unrealized gains/losses, pending rewards, claimable tokens, maybe even debts.  ￼

Because in DeFi, value is more than just “token in wallet” — LP, staking, lending, vaults, etc. matter too.

3. Historical Performance & PnL Tracking
	•	Keep track of assets over time: when they were acquired, cost basis, and performance (gains/losses) after trades and strategy execution.  ￼
	•	Show charts: value over time, realized vs unrealized gains, exposures to different assets/chains/protocols.

This helps evaluate whether your agents’ decisions are actually profitable or just “active.”

4. Alerts & Notifications on Wallet Activity

Since you already plan alerts: combine wallet tracking so user gets notified when:
	•	Large balance change
	•	LP or pool withdrawals / deposits
	•	Reward claimable
	•	Unusual liquidity changes
	•	Exposure exceeds risk thresholds

This merges well with your governance + risk-agent vision. Real trackers do this too.  ￼

5. Privacy & Read-Only Security

The tracker should never require private keys or permission to spend. Only public addresses + read-only API calls / blockchain queries.  ￼
This ensures security and trust — especially if users connect multiple wallets.

6. Efficient Data Fetching / Caching / Chain-agnostic RPC Handling
	•	Handle different RPC endpoints (for ETH, Base, Fraxtal, Solana, etc.)
	•	Rate-limit, caching, fallback logic (in case chain RPC is slow)
	•	Unified interface for querying balances, token lists, LPs even if chains have different standards (EVM vs non-EVM)

Since you’re already using chains with different protocols, this is crucial to avoid bugs.
