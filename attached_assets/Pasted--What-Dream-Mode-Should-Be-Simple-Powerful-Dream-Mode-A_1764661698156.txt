🌙 What Dream Mode Should Be (Simple + Powerful)

Dream Mode =
Agents continue scanning, thinking, debating, and analyzing while the user is offline — then generate a Morning Report.

Not fake.
Not too complex.
Just automated scheduled tasks + agent reasoning.

⸻

⭐ Core Dream Mode Flow

1. User clicks “Enable Dream Mode”

This sets a flag in DB:

dream_mode_enabled = true
last_run = NOW()
sleep_start = NOW()

2. Every 10 minutes (while OFF)

You already have:
	•	Scout scanning
	•	Risk filtering
	•	Insights generator

Dream Mode just runs these automatically:

runScanCycle()
runRiskCycle()
runInsightsCycle()
runAnomalyDetection()
logFindings()

Store each finding in a table:
dream_insights

Example entry:

{
  "type": "yield_opportunity",
  "summary": "Found 7.2% on FRAX-DAI Curve",
  "timestamp": "03:42 AM",
  "confidence": 0.78
}

3. When user returns (morning)

Detect login or browser open.
Then generate a compiled Morning Report:

🌅 Morning Report (the deliverable)

Section 1: Summary

NeuroNet scanned 143 opportunities while you slept.
8 opportunities passed risk filters.
3 were marked as high-confidence signals.

Section 2: Top Opportunities

Card layout:
	•	Yield
	•	Risk score
	•	Source
	•	Confidence
	•	Chains
	•	Agent comments

Opportunity: 6.9% FRAX USDC on Fraxtal
Risk Score: 22/100
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Low volatility, strong liquidity, stable TVL.”

Section 3: Night Insights

・Volatility on SOL increased 32%
・Unusual TVL spike on Base stablepools
・Correlated dump across ETH LST pairs

Section 4: Agent Thoughts (Fun part)

Let agents write mini logs:

[Scout] Detected 6 pools changing > 4% APY.
[Risk] Flagged 2 pools for shallow liquidity.
[Meta] Adjusted strategy preference toward stable yields.

Section 5: Recommended Action

Simple one-liner:

"Best risk-adjusted opportunity: Stake in Curve FRAX pool."


⸻

🧠 What Makes Dream Mode Look Smart (but easy)

✔ Automatically scheduled tasks

You’re just calling already existing functions.

✔ Night-time timestamps

Makes it feel “alive”.

✔ AI-written summary

Claude can compile the morning report.

✔ Visual dashboard

Judges will be like:

“Damn… this thing works 24/7 even when the owner is sleeping.”

🛠️ How to Build Dream Mode (Implementation Blueprint)

Backend logic
	1.	Create dream_mode_enabled flag
	2.	Create table dream_insights
	3.	Cron job (every 10 min):

if dream_mode_enabled:
    run scans
    store results

Morning Report generation
	•	Fetch all dream_insights for last sleep session
	•	Summarize with LLM
	•	Build JSON:

{
  summary: "...",
  insights: [...],
  top_opps: [...],
  agent_logs: [...],
  recommended_action: "..."
}

Frontend UI
	•	Button: “Enter Dream Mode”
	•	Animation: Screen dims → “NeuroNet is now dreaming…”
	•	Morning: “Good morning, here’s what we found.”
