🧨 STRESS TESTING (Agent Stress Lab)

This is the part judges love because it shows:
	•	robustness
	•	safety
	•	reliability
	•	risk-awareness
	•	professional-grade governance

🚨 WHAT A GOOD STRESS TESTING SYSTEM SHOULD DO

Stress Testing =
simulate disasters and measure how your agents react.

You allow the user to choose scenarios like:

✅ Market Crash (ETH -35% in 10 minutes)
✅ Liquidity Rug (TVL -70% instantly)
✅ Volatility Spike (30x volatility)
✅ Oracle Failure / Wrong Prices
✅ Transaction Reverts
✅ Gas Price Explodes
✅ Chain Congestion
✅ Yield Pool Drains
✅ Governance Attack Simulation

When a user picks a scenario, your system should:
	1.	Generate fake market data for that scenario
	2.	Send it through your full agent pipeline
	3.	Observe how Scout, Risk, Meta, Execution behave
	4.	Produce a final “resilience score”
	5.	Generate a report:

Stress Scenario: ETH Flash Crash
Result: Agents reacted in 1.3 seconds
RiskAgent vetoed 100% of unsafe actions
MetaAgent froze high-risk strategies
ExecutionAgent cancelled pending tx
Outcome: Stable. No losses.
Resilience Score: 94/100

Bro… that alone looks like a research paper.

🧱 HOW TO IMPLEMENT (EASY VERSION)

1. Create a set of pre-defined scenarios

Example JSON:

{
  "flash_crash": {
    "eth_price": -0.35,
    "tvl_drop": -0.60,
    "volatility": 30,
    "oracle_noise": 5
  },
  "rug_pull": {
    "tvl_drop": -0.75,
    "risk_event": true
  }
}

2. Override your data fetcher

Instead of real data, feed the fake stress data into:
	•	Scout analysis
	•	Risk evaluation
	•	Meta decision
	•	Execution simulation

3. Gather responses

Things to collect:
	•	execution cancelled?
	•	approvals dropped?
	•	risk score spikes?
	•	agent disagreements?
	•	reasoning logs?

4. Score it

Simple formula:

resilience =
    (risk_accuracy * 0.4) +
    (meta_stability * 0.3) +
    (reaction_speed * 0.2) +
    (execution_safety * 0.1)

5. Generate a report

Feed the JSON into Gemini:

Summarize how the agents reacted to this stress test.
Highlight stability, failures, and suggested improvements.

🎨 WHAT THE UI SHOULD LOOK LIKE

Stress Lab UI:
	•	Dropdown: Choose scenario
	•	Button: RUN STRESS TEST
	•	Animated “simulation running” state (5 seconds)
	•	Results page with:
	•	Graphs
	•	Logs
	•	Final Resilience Score
	•	Recommendations
	•	Agent commentary

Example card:

RESULT  
Scenario: Flash Crash  
Agents Reaction: Stable  
Resilience Score: 92/100  
Scout: Suspended rotation  
Risk: Triggered red alert  
Meta: Shifted to defensive mode  
Execution: Cancelled all pending swaps
